* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
This is the third project in the TripleTen Software Engineer program. This project is made using a Figma design and formatted so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
